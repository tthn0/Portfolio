# Designs with Website

These are some designs that I made actual websites for but am unfortunately unable to recover the source code.

## Discord Bot Website

* I also made an actual Discord bot with Python, Discord.py, and MongoDB alongside this website
* It was a fun and interactive game bot with 12 unique games and 25+ daily users
* Includes a banking/economy system with fully featured shops, usable items, and interactive pets
* I originally used a MySQL database but migrated to MongoDB

# Designs Only

These designs do not have an actual app or website and are purely just prototypes.
